# akkusativ

akkusativ makes electronic instruments for musicians and
artists. They operate out of [Pedal
Markt](https://pedalmarkt.com) in Berlin, Germany.

## All Animation – dynamic effects mixer

All Animation is a crossfader, a signal router and an
envelope follower. Use it to build your own dynamic effects
and feedback machines: mixers, gates, auto-swell and tremolo
effects. Control it using CV or Expression, or use *it* to
control other CV-enabled devices.

### FADE

FADE lets you gradually crossfade between `A RETURN` and
`B RETURN` signals. Use the range knob by itself or in
combination with an expression pedal or a CV source to
control the position of the crossfade.

The range knob acts as an attenuverter – the range of the
fade curve is going to be zero when the knob is at noon.
In that position, both `A RETURN` and `B RETURN` signals will
be at 100% independently of the CV or Expression going into
the FADE input jack. In the fully counter-clockwise position,
CV values 0V to 5V would fade from 100% `A RETURN` to 100%
`B RETURN`. When the range is full clockwise the direction
of the fade is reversed.

### FLIP

FLIP lets you smoothly reverse the position on the FADE
curve. 20-80 fade becomes 80-20, 45-55 becomes 55-45 and so on.
The attack knob controls how fast the FLIP happens. The
release knob – the time it takes to settle back into the
original position on the FADE curve once the FLIP is
disengaged.

FLIP can be triggered via the footswitch or via the gate
input.

### CYCLE

It is possible to CYCLE the FLIP. That way the pedal would
move back and forth on the fade curve with the speed
controlled by the attack and release knobs, the depth
controlled by the original position on the FADE curve.

### ROUTE

The signal router part of the pedal lets you send the input
signal into two effect chains and re-route them with a flick
of a switch. Possible routing options are:

* `IN -> A SEND` | `IN       -> B SEND`
* `IN -> A SEND` | `A RETURN -> B SEND`
* `IN -> B SEND` | `B RETURN -> A SEND`


All Animation also sports a second, always active output
(marked `A~B`) for making feedback patches.



### TRACE

TRACE is an envelope follower. Use it to turn the
dynamics of your `IN`, `A RETURN`, `B RETURN` or external
signal into control voltage. Patch that control voltage
back into All Animation to create gate, compressor and
swell-type effects or send it into external gear.

Patching an external signal into `TRACE IN` gives
you a sidechain: a way to control the Fade using an
external instrument.

The `sens` knob controls the sensitivity of the envelope
follower. The `form` toggle controls the shape of the TRACE
output, the options are gate, continuos or trigger.
